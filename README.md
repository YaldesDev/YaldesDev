# About me:

**YaldesDev/YaldesDev** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python, Ruby and React
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related!
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: on @Yallesapretesa
- âš¡ Fun fact: I speak 3 languages, on my way to the 4th (and no, not programing languages unfortunately :P)
